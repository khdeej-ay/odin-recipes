    <h1>Chicken Biryani</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biryani is an intricate rice dish made with layers of curried meat and rice. Given its use of adornments and luxurious finishes, it’s no surprise that biryani has roots in Persian cuisine. There are two main methods of making biryani: Kachi (raw) biryani, made with raw meat and parboiled rice and cooked together, and Pakki (cooked) biryani, in which cooked meat and parboiled rice are steamed together. In Pakistan, pakki (or cooked) biryani is most common, with several prominent varieties such as Sindhi, Karachi-style, and Bombay biryani. This recipe is an amalgamation of these styles and is similar to what you'd find at a typical Pakistani or Indian restaurant or dinner party.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil/Ghee: I've used oil for fluidity and ghee for taste.</li> 
        <li>Onions: You can either thinly slice them (more traditional) or finely chop. </li>
        <li>Bone-in, cut up, skinless chicken: I buy pre-cut up pieces of a whole chicken, but bone-in chicken thighs work too. You can also use boneless chicken, though it may require a shorter cooking time.</li>
        <li>Whole spices: A generous amount of whole spices are a distinct characteristic of biryani. Whole spices are meant to be discarded while eating, but if you don't want to bite into them, feel free place them in a spice/muslin bag.</li>
        <li>Garlic + Ginger: I've given their quantities in whole form and tablespoons. I use a mortar and pestle or a food processor to crush them.</li>
        <li>Tomatoes: I've found keeping the tomatoes to a minimum gives it just the right amount of tang.</li>
        <li>Yogurt: Not only does a yogurt marinade make the chicken more tender and flavorful, but it also makes cooking the biryani much smoother.</li>
        <li>Rice: I suggest using aged, long-grain basmati rice.</li>
        <li>Dried Plums (Alu Bukhara): Alu Bukhara are often used in biryani to give a sweet, tangy taste. You can substitute with dried prunes or omit altogehter.</li>
        <li>Biryani masala spices: 
            <ul>
                <li>1 medium dried bay leaf (tez patta)</li>
                <li>2 dried button red chili peppers (sukhi lal mirch)</li>
                <li>1 small whole mace (javetri)</li>
                <li>1 2-inch cinnamon stick (daarchini)</li>
                <li>4-5 whole cloves (loung)</li>
                <li>1 black cardamom (badi elaichi)</li>
                <li>1 star anise (baadiyan)</li>
                <li>3-4 green cardamom pods (elaichi)</li>
                <li>1 tsp roasted cumin seeds or black cumin seeds (shahzeera)</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp black peppercorns (kaali mirch)</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp fennel (saunf)</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp carom seeds (ajwain)</li></ul>
            </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make Biryani masala for this recipe, combine all the spices in a spice grinder and process until mostly smooth. Makes ~2 tbsp, which is the exact quantity you’ll need for this recipe.</li>
        <li>Marinate the chicken in spices and yogurt. This infuses the chicken with noticeable flavor. Ideally, marinate overnight or for at least a couple hours, but I tested and found that it’s still very tasty if you marinate just before making the biryani.</li>
        <li>Take the chicken out of the fridge before you start preparing the biryani. Allowing the chicken to come closer to room temperature helps it cook more evenly and stay tender.</li>
        <li>After sautéing the chicken in the hot oil, add water and allow the chicken to simmer gently, covered, over low heat.</li>
        <li>Prepare the biryani masala (or use store-bought) and marinate the chicken. Cook the chicken curry. While it’s cooking over low heat, prepare the rice.</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil and parboil the rice. Drain and set aside. Layer half of the rice, all of the chicken, and then the remaining rice on top. Add the finishing touches.</li>
        <li>Bring it all together for a final steam (‘dum‘). Allow steam to develop, then lower the heat and let the flavors meld.</li> 
    </ol>
