    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This flavorful garlic naan bread is cooked on the stovetop, in a cast-iron skillet. It makes a wonderful accompaniment to your favorite Indian dish.</p>
    <p>Though we most often associate naan with Indian cuisine, versions of it are prepared throughout Asia. In fact, naan is simply the Persian word for bread, and in Iran, it's a generic term that doesn't correlate with any specific style. </p>
    <p>Elsewhere, naan is a leavened flatbread typically baked in a tandoori oven, which reaches upwards of 900Â°F to result in the bread's signature charred brown spots and gentle puff.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water, at room temperature</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup full-fat plain yogurt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup whole milk, at room temperature</li>
        <li>Cooking oil, for the bowl</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 stick melted unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a glass measuring cup, combine the yeast, sugar, and water and let sit for 10 minutes. In the meantime, mix the flour, baking soda, and baking powder in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the yeast mixture, yogurt, and milk and stir into the dry ingredients. Knead with your hands until the dough forms a smooth, soft ball, about 2 minutes. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Leave at room temperature until doubled in size, about 2 hours. </li>
        <li>Remove the dough from the bowl and turn onto a well-floured surface. Knead it briefly and divide the dough into 12 equal portions. Roll it into 1/4-inch-thick ovals, approximately 6 inches wide.</li>
        <li>Heat a cast-iron skillet over moderately high heat. Sprinkle each portion with minced garlic and press it into the dough. Brush the dough with melted butter and place in skillet. Cook for about one minute, until the dough puffs up. Flip, cover the pan, and cook for one more minute. Remove from the pan, brush both sides with butter, and sprinkle with salt. Place in a towel-lined bowl until ready to serve.</li>
